To install MySQL : 

If you have Docker, create an image with the following command line "docker pull mysql" to get the latest one.
The MySQL image requires that you supply a root password. You cannot set this in the Docker Desktop GUI and must do so through the command line (PowerShell or cmd):
docker run --name my-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword -d mysql. A terminal window should appear. First run mysql -u root -p and enter your specified root password when prompted.
Once you reach the MySQL prompt, run the following commands 'CREATE DATABASE chatopDB;',
then retrieve the information from the script.sql file and copy and paste it into the terminal window.

Otherwise with MySQL Workbench : Import the sql script from the chaTop-Backend/src/main/resources/script.sql and execute it, this will create the tables
From MySQL terminal: Use the command SOURCE </absolute/path/to/script>
